What are some websited that you go on that have alot of comments and conversations? Ex: facebook,twitter, youtube

notice how many of the comments are in the same line as eachotherm this makes it easy to follow who is talking to who or what thread they are on etc...

another example of this is comments/ replies on facebok.

do you see the indentation here?

	print("we wil buy the iphone")
else:
	print("we will buy the andriod")

Why do we use indentation?

The reason we use indenttion is to identify what is happenning across multiple lines of code. Code that is indenteted the same is called a block code . 

In the code above, we can see that each possibility will output something different (see how the indentation of each output falls under a condtition )

If we dont indent properly we will get errors in our code....


price = int(input("How much is the phone?: $"))

if price < 400:
print("we wil buy the iphone")

_____ 

logical error :

if price < 400:
	print("we wil buy the iphone")
	print("we have made a decision")
else:
	print("we will buy the andriod")
print("we have made a decision")
