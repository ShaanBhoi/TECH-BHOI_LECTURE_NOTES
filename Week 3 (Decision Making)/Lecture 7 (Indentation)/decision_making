Decision making

Say you ask to borrow a friends phone, and you accidentally drop it and the screen cracks. HOW SAD!!

Now you have to replace ur friends phone, but say you only have 400$ in your account. 

We need do decide now what phone we are going to get him. It would be nice to get him an iphone (like they had), but we also have the possibility of getting him an andrid phone. 

Assessing the situtation, we can safely say that we will buy the Iphone if it is less than 400$, otherwise we will get the android.

We can model our problem as follows:

if the price of the phone is less than 400$, we will buy the iphone.
Otherwise(else)
we will buy the android
_________________________
translating our problem into code:

writing the problem in code is very similar to how we do it in english...

if price < 400:
	print("we wil buy the iphone")
else:
	print("we will buy the andriod")

_________________________
how conditions are written

if [condition]:
	##when condition is True
	do this
else:
	##any case ouside of condition being True
	do this
_________________________

lets see this in action:
## try it 3 times, 350,400,450
price = int(input("How much is the phone?: $"))

if price < 400:
	print("we wil buy the iphone")
else:
	print("we will buy the andriod")
