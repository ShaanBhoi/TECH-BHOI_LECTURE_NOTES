## question 1
## create an if statement that checks a variable is exactly equal to the value stored in the variable, create an output for this

myNum = 10
if myNum == 10:
	print("My number is",10 )

##question 2
## expand q1 to have an else statement

## question3 
## create an if condition that compares two objects (not using exactly equals), have an output, create an elif statement with two different objects (not using ==), have an output, create an else statement with an output.

myNum = 10
myStr = "yes"
myBool = False

if myNum > myBool:
	print(myNum,"is greater than",int(myBool))
elif myStr != "no":
	print("my string",myStr," is not the same as \"no\"")
else:
	print("every other condition ")

##question 4
## create a letter grade calculator, by using multiple elif statements with multiple conditions and printing appropriate information. grade is given by input A:[80,inf),B:[70,80),C:[60,70),D:[50,60),F:[-inf,50)
grade = float(input("grade: "))

if grade >= 90:
    print("You received an A")

elif grade >= 80 and grade< 90:        
	print("You received a B")

elif grade >= 70 and grade< 80:
    print("You received a C")

elif grade >= 60 and grade< 70:
    print("You received a D")

else:
    print("Sorry, you received an F")

## question5
## expand q4 to have +/- for increments of 5 
## implement if [40,50) u have an E, output that a student has opportunity to take a supplemental exam
## implement F grade for (1,40)
## implement ABS for absent [0,1]
