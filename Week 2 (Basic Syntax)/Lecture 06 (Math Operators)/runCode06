Programming and mathematics go together like peanut butter and jelly, most of the time they come smashed together.
Many of the skills needed in math, can be found all over programming. The most important is having good problem solving skills, critical thinking skills, and attention to detail.

All of the math operations we have learnt in grade school are found in even the most complicated of programs!

Common Math Operations:

Addition:
3 + 4 = 7 
Subtraction:
4 + 3 = 1
Multiplication:
3 * 4 = 12
Division:
2 / 4 = 0.5Â 

New Math operations:

Floor Division:
