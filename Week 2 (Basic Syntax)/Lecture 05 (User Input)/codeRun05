WHAT IS USER INPUT

A realworld example of taking user input, is whenever we log into zoom/REPL, we need to input our username and password.
Can you think of any real world examples that can be related to user input?

HOW TO TAKE AN INPUT

InÂ python; it is very simple to get input from a user, all we need to do is call the input() function.
This will be used to take information from the user via the terminal.
When using the input function, we can add information on what we want from the user by putting a string inside the function.

Ex:    input("what is your name : ")

Whenever we take an input, it is always taken as a str
by default, but we can force this to be a different type using the type conversion functions seen last class

how to take user input
input("your question here : ")

how to store a users answer into a variable 
userName = input("What is your name ? : ")
print(userName)

type conversion
myAge = int(input("What is your age? : "))

to use a float or int if we are unsure of a numeric input? Why?
we always want to use a float, becasue if we are unsure, it can handle both ints and floats. thus it is more powerful.
