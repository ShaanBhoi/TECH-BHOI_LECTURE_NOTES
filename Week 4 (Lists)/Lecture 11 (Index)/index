'''
Each element in a list has its own position. We call this an index, it starts at 0. 

in regular counting we start at 1, but for lists we start at 0
1,2,3,4
[0,1,2,3]
one= 1
two = 2
three = 3
four = 4

mylist = [one,two,three,4]
# in the following list the index of one is 0 but the index of two is 1
print(mylist)

## accessing the element at the index in the array
print(mylist[0])

## accessing elements using negative indexes
print(mylist[-1])

## accessing a range of elements in the list
print(mylist[1:3])

Example:
What happens if you leave out the beginning or last value for accessing a range?

What if we use a range of negative indexes??
