'''
Each element in a list has its own position. We call this an index, it starts at 0. 

in regular counting we start at 1, but for lists we start at 0
1,2,3,4
[0,1,2,3]
one= 1
two = 2
three = 3
four = 4

mylist = [one,two,three,4]
# in the following list the index of one is 0 but the index of two is 1
print(mylist)

## accessing the element at the index in the array
print(mylist[0])

## accessing elements using negative indexes
print(mylist[-1])

## accessing a range of elements in the list
print(mylist[1:3])

Example:
What happens if you leave out the beginning or last value for accessing a range?

What if we use a range of negative indexes??

Quiz 
Complete the code below to print the value of the variable with the name three (we have two options)
mylist = [one,two,three,4]
print(mylist[__________])

_____________________

Wha tif we want to access some element of the list but do not know the index of where it is?
we can write the name of the list with a dot (.) and the keyword index.
Example

indexOfThree = mylist.index(three)
print(indexOfThree)
