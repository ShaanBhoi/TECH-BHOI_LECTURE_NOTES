Now that we know all of our 4 main data types like the back of our hand...


We are going to introduce a new one, called "List".

This is like a special data type. 

We can use a list to store multiple different data types (or all the same or a mix however you wanna use it)

Can you give some examples of why lists are useful? Think of some harder ones, grocery lists and names of friends is too easy...

Using the same way that we declare variables to store other data types, we will use the same format to store a list as the value for the variable.
What is unique about this is that we can then in turn store values of data in the list. 

Sometimes you will hear people call "lists" an "array" and vice versa, they refer to the same thing.

## How to declare a variable
variableName = value 

## how to declare a list

listName = [val1,val2,...,valN]

##Example: We want to create a list (with an appropriate name) to store all the names of our family members

myFamily = ["sister","brother","dog","mother","father"]

When declaring a list, we need 2 things:
1. square brackets to contain the things we want to put in the list <- we will refer to these things as elements
2. commas to seperate each element in the array 

___________

Quiz:
declare a variable with the name shapes, store inside of it the strings of square,rectangel,circle 

shapes = ["square", "rectangle", "circle"]

___________
Quiz :

What are the two most important parts in creating a list?

a) the equals sign and parenthses
b) square parenthses and quotes
c) square parenthses and commas
d) open square parenthses and a close square parenthses 


________
Can you fix the code ?

colours = ("strawberry red' , peach pink : "sundown orange"],

___________

Use a list to store more than one value in a variable.
