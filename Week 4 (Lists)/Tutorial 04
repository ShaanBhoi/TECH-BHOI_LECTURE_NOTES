## question 1 ##
################
## create a "groceries" list, that in the beginning stores no values. Add 10 items to the list an check if a value(as an input) is contained in the list. Print out an appropriate message using an if statment.
'''
groceries = []
groceries.append("eggs")
groceries.append("milk")
groceries.append("bread")
groceries.append("banana")
groceries.append("apple")

inList = input("What is the item you want to see if it is in the list? :")

if inList in groceries:
	print(inList,"is in or gorocery list")
else:
	print(inList,"is not on our grocery list")

## question 2 ##
################
## Expand the code from question 1 to take a user input yes/no to add the item that isnt in the list
'''
groceries = []
groceries.append("eggs")
groceries.append("milk")
groceries.append("bread")

## question 3 ##
################
## write a program that will give the largest and smallest numbers in a list that has more than 10 elements but less than or 20.
## hint: use multiple conditions in an if statement and the len function

'''
list3= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

	print("Highest value in the list is: ",max(listName))
	print("Lowest value in the list is: ",min(listName))
elif numOfElems > 20:
	print("There is too many items in your list")

elif numOfElems <= 10 :
	print("There is not enough items in your list")

'''
################
## question 4 ##
################
## write a program to delete a specific (element number as an input) from a list
## elements start at 1 and not 0 
'''
mylist=[1,4,7,3,6,9,3,0,7,8]
listName=mylist
print(listName)

	print("That element number is too high\nPick something smaller than ",top,"but less than 1")
elif elementToRemove < 1:
	print("That element number is too low\nPick something bigger than 1,but less than ",top)
elif elementToRemove>=1 and elementToRemove<=top:
	listName.remove(listName[elementToRemove-1])
	print("The list is now :",listName)
