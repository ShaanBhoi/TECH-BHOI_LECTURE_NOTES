# TECH-BHOI_LECTURE_NOTES
This is the central repository for all the information pertaining to the 8-week prograaming for all ages course.

I created this course for the SEG 2105 Assignment 5 for the fall semester of 2020.

For the purposes of the course, it will be limited to the first 4 weeks.

I will be continuing to work on it in order to add all of the components listed in the course package. Due to time constraints of the course, i am unable to complete the full course for the term end date. This is my first large scale personal project.

The textbook has been created with the help of the online service canva.
I am testing/teaching this course with ZOOM.
The online IDE is supported by REPL.

For this course, I haave even started my own company to teach this, creating a website with the help of googles small business services.
For the compnay (TECH Bhoi) i have created a twitter account, linkedin company page, and an email.
