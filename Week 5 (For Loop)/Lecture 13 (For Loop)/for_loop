##for_loop


"""
Being a programmer promotes the use of technology to do our mundane chores/tasks. Sometimes, we need to repeat a task (we call this looping) , this is where we will see how important the for loop is for doing the same thing again and again. Say you pack your schoolbag with some items (can be stored as a list). We put into our bag : homework, pencilcase, lunchbox, textbooks,computer. And when we get to our locker at school we want to take all those things out and put them in our locker for the day. 

ENGLISH
What we can say is that for every item in our bag, take out the item an put it into our locker.
LOGIC
for item in bag, remove and put in locker.
PSEUDO CODE 
locker = [] ## is empty originally
bag = [hw,pencilcase,lunchbox,textbooks,computer]
for item in bag:
	locker.append(item)
	bag.remove(item) 
print bag 
print locker 

exercise, change the above code and run it to see what happens
